Three.js shape loaders for [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) ([readable html](https://stevage.github.io/geojson-spec/)) and [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) formats. Supports generation of three.js line geometry in addition to flat and extruded tringulated meshes. All generated geometry are transformed and centered using 64-bit Javascript floating point operations with meshes are offset to retain precision in GPU operations.

Uses [@turfjs/unkink-polygon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/unkink-polygon), [@mapbox/delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator), [@kninnug/constrainautor](https://github.com/kninnug/Constrainautor), and [@placemark/betterknown](https://github.com/placemark/betterknown) packages for polygon triangulation and WKT parsing. World GeoJSON file courtesy of [geojson-maps](https://geojson-maps.kyd.au/).

Some key features supported by this project:
- Support for detecting and fixing self-intersecting polygons so they tringulate correctly.
- Uses constrained delaunay triangulation for correct, high quality triangulation and support for inner vertices.
- Smooth surface normals are generated for ellipsoid-projected shapes.
- Outputs centered geometry with and matrix transform offset to avoid preceision-related artifacts on CPU and GPU when processing high-detail shapes.
- Supports altitude values.

# Installation

```
npm install github:@gkjohnson/three-geojson
```

# Use

```js
// load the content
const result = await new GeoJSON().loadAsync( url );

// extract polygon lines and project them onto the globe
const transformer = new GeoJSONTransformer();
result.polygons.forEach( polygon => {

  const line = polygon.getLineObject();
  transformer.transformObject( line );
  scene.add( line );

} );
```
